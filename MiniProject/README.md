Great! You're putting together a **mini project on RIP with Dynamic Routing**, covering core routing concepts and protocol behavior. Here's a **structured project guide** based on your notes, with suggestions for implementation in tools like **Cisco Packet Tracer** or **GNS3**:

## üõ∞Ô∏è **Mini Project: RIP with Dynamic Routing**

---

### üéØ **Project Objective**

To understand and implement **Dynamic Routing** using **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)**, simulate routing between multiple routers, and observe how routing tables are updated automatically.

---

### üìò **Theory Recap**

#### üîÅ **Routing**

* **Routing** is the process of forwarding packets from one network to another.
* **Router** connects at least **two networks** and makes forwarding decisions based on routing tables.

---

#### üß≠ **Routing Types**

##### üß± **Static Routing**

* Manually configured.
* Not scalable for large networks.
* Example: 1 ‚Äî 2 ‚Äî 3 ‚Äî 4 ‚Äî 5
  ‚Üí Each router needs to manually know about all others.

##### ‚öôÔ∏è **Dynamic Routing**

* Routers automatically exchange routes using **routing protocols**.
* Reduces manual effort.
* Key Protocols:

  * **RIP / RIPng (for IPv6)**
  * **OSPF (Single & Multi-Area)**
  * **EIGRP** (Cisco proprietary)

---

#### üì° **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)**

* Type: **Distance Vector**
* Metric: **Hop count**
* Max hops: **15** (16 = unreachable)
* Periodic updates every 30 seconds.
* Versions:

  * **RIP v1**: Classful, no subnet info, IPv4 only.
  * **RIP v2**: Classless (supports subnetting), IPv4.
  * **RIPng**: Next-gen RIP for **IPv6**.

---

### üß™ **Implementation Plan (Cisco Packet Tracer or GNS3)**

#### üñ•Ô∏è **Network Topology**

* Connect **5 Routers**: R1 ‚Äî R2 ‚Äî R3 ‚Äî R4 ‚Äî R5
* Each router connects to its own network (e.g., R1 ‚Üí 192.168.1.0/24, R2 ‚Üí 192.168.2.0/24, ...)

#### ‚öôÔ∏è **Steps**

1. **Assign IP addresses** to all interfaces.
2. **Enable RIP on each router**:

   * Use **RIP v2** (for subnetting support).
   * Advertise directly connected networks.
3. **Check Routing Tables**:

   * Use `show ip route` on each router.
   * Confirm automatic route propagation.

#### üßë‚Äçüíª **Sample Commands (Cisco IOS)**

```bash
Router(config)# router rip
Router(config-router)# version 2
Router(config-router)# no auto-summary
Router(config-router)# network 192.168.1.0
Router(config-router)# network 10.0.0.0
```

> Use `show ip protocols` and `show ip route` to verify.

---

### üåê **Communication Types**

* **Unicast**: One-to-one
* **Broadcast**: One-to-all in the same subnet
* **Multicast**: One-to-many (e.g., routing updates sent to 224.0.0.9 in RIP v2)

---

### üìà **Advanced Topics (Optional)**

* **RIPng** for IPv6 networks
* **Subnetting** in RIP v2
* **Comparison**: RIP vs OSPF vs EIGRP
* Configure **OSPF Single Area** (Area 0) for comparison

---

### üìù **Project Report (for submission)**

Include the following:

* **Objective**
* **Theory** (Routing, RIP, differences between versions)
* **Topology diagram**
* **IP addressing table**
* **Configuration commands**
* **Routing table screenshots**
* **Observations and conclusions**

---

Would you like me to generate a **topology diagram**, **sample report template**, or **Packet Tracer (.pkt) file example** for this?

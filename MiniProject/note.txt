Routing  - forwarding the traffic from one network to another network

Roter - 2 networks - router 2 networks

Static routing - the growing number of networks should be manually added to every router

1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5

All router should be updated with all networks information

Manual work

Dynamic Routing
	rip
	ospf
	eigrp
For every router - propagates its own network in one routing protocol 
- routing protocol - routing protocol will communicate with another router and update the information

unicasting
broadcasting
multicasting - 

15 routers - 15 hops
Rip nextgen


Version - IPv6 also

Rip subnetting

Ospf
	single area OSPF
	multi area OSPF

RIP VERSION 2

this is mini project like RIP with Dynamic Routing
